"""
mythical_stable.patterns.commands
===================================
Command pattern — encapsulate requests as reversible objects.

Each command captures everything needed to execute and undo an action.
CommandHistory maintains a stack of executed commands and supports undo/redo.

The Command Protocol is defined in mythical_stable.protocols. DispatchCommand
and RecallCommand satisfy it structurally.
